# intresmeth

This is the software I made to easily extract data for my research.

To use the program, because it does not yet have a command line interface,
change WORDS and TIMEFRAME in the main function to your liking, and upload the program to karora with the following command:

scp /home/user/Documents/informatiekunde/intresmeth/final_project/program/analyzer.py s1234567@karora.let.rug.nl:~/

And ofcourse adjust the file paths and the student number to your needs.


You can then log into karora, run the program, and wait!
